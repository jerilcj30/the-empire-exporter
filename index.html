          <p>
            Do you feel frustrated because you are unable to find what product to export and what products are most in
            demand in a specific country?
          </p>

          <p>
            Is the thought on the process of identifying importers not letting you sleep at night? Are you consistently
            thinking of an easy solution to market your products to importers who are looking for your product?
          </p>

          <p>Have you always found various online B2B marketplaces like Alibaba, DHgate, Chinabrands, Ec21, eWorldTrade, ExportHub etc not effective enough?</p>

          <p>
            If your answer is an enormous and resounding "YES", then I have good news for you. I'm going to walk you
            through my biggest kept secret.

          </p>

          <p>By the time we're done here, you will know the exact secret that I use to generate 100's of export
            inquiries
            by identifying attractive markets, its competition and analyzing suppliers of the target market. We will
            examine the importers in great detail and try the exact advertising strategies that I used to target these
            importers for inquiries right from your laptop.

          </p>

              inquiries and shortlisted the buyers, which suited me based on the quantity, price and payment terms.
              Finally, I got a confirmed order from an Australian buyer for 10,000 pieces of T-shirts for every 3 months
              as a repeating order. The worth of goods is roughly around $23,000. The payment terms are through LC at
              sight, and my banker has promised me to provide packaging credit. I take this opportunity to thank you for
              your insights.”</blockquote>
