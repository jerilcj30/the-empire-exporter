               <p class="c_both">But before I do...</p>
               <p>Let me quickly show you exactly how I became a successful merchant exporter. I was working in a company for many years and lost my job in the year 2014.</p>
               <p>I struggled for 2 years, trying to identify potential importers who would be interested in my product.</p>
               <p> <span class="span">The first thing I did was joining various online B2B marketplaces like Alibaba, DHgate, Chinabrands, Ec21, eWorldTrade, ExportHub to contact buyers.</span> </p>
               <p>And I burned through what previous little extra cash I had trying to be a premium member of these portals and absolutely nothing happened. And after months of long nights, I had exactly two things to show for my effort...</p>
               <p>zero sales. Overwhelming doubt and like everything else I'd tried to that point...It was a dead end.</p>
               <p>But what happened next, was the desperation move that has changed my life...</p>
               <p>I started getting 100+ new leads every day and more important than any of the stuff: I was getting tons of orders!</p>
               <p>I had unknowingly stumbled into something really big...and identifying buyers and closing deals was never a pain any more.</p>
               <p>Long story short: I quit my job</p>
               <p>So, I know this was a lot to take in...</p>
               <p>All I wanted to let you know is that there are amazing solutions available for free to scale up your export business.</p>
